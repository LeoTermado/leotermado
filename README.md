**Dual B.Sc. Business Informatics (CBS/KDVZ, 2025–2028) · Self-taught developer · Swift & Java · AI/ML-curious**

Hi — I’m Leo. I just finished my Abitur and will start my dual B.Sc. in Business Informatics at **CBS International Business School (Cologne)** with **KDVZ (Frechen)** on **September 1, 2025**.  
I’m largely self-taught and took 3 long-time courses in computer science at school. I have practical experience with **Java** and building software solutions (incl. databases/SQL), and lately I’m focusing on **Swift + Xcode**. Long-term I’m aiming for an **M.Sc. in Software Engineering abroad**.

## What I’m working on

### Dynamic Drive (iOS, WIP)
**Idea:** live car telemetry shapes the music you hear.  
I was inspired by Mercedes’ “Sound Drive”: I use an **OBD-II Bluetooth scanner** to stream real-time data to the phone; the app maps those signals to audio parameters via **AudioKit**.

- **Stack:** Swift · Xcode · AudioKit · OBD-II (Bluetooth)
- **Behavior (example):** at standstill only the **bass** (with high/low cut) is audible; as speed increases, more **stems** fade in and filters open smoothly.
- **Focus right now:** solid **audio engine** first, then **Bluetooth** connection; **UI** later.

### KI Project (archive / not finished)
This project wasn’t completed, but I learned a lot about **AI/ML**, **backpropagation**, and prototyping in **Python** and **Java**.
